# How to set up and use `jupyter-lab` over ssh

# Server setup
1. Install `jupyterlab` globally on your computer
2. Add `jupyterlab`'s location to your `PATH`
3. Start `jupyterlab` in a headless fashion on a specific port (I've chosen `5055`)

# Client setup
1. Connect to server and listen to lab port (`5055`)
